[SiYuan](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan) is a local-first personal knowledge management system, supports fine-grained block-level reference, and Markdown WYSIWYG. This is a theme for it.

## 💌 Origin

Tsundoku “積 ん 読” , a Japanese word，explained in Wikipedia as “Tsundoku is acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them. It is also used to refer to books ready for reading later when they are on a bookshelf.”

> Any PKM approach that doesn’t tie into execution tools is destined to languish on the back burner forever

I use this name to wake myself up and hope that SiYuan will help me make gradual progress and  get things done better, instead of becoming another dustbin for relieving intellectual anxiety and satisfying my digital hoarding disorder.
